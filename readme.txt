This is, hopefully, a series of personal projects that will lead to personal growth.

What I have here is an image containing a list of programming challenge, sourced from 4chan's /g/. I'll be attempting to work through as many of them as I can until I get a job and have something better to do. It's a pretty haphazard, unstructured list, so I'm sure I'll be jumping into a lot of weird and potentially useful things. 

First goal: throw together a quick little program to help me manage the list.
