This is, hopefully, a series of personal projects that will lead to personal growth.

What I have here is an image containing a list of programming challenge, sourced from 4chan's /g/. I'll be attempting to work through as many of them as I can until I get a job and have something better to do. It's a pretty haphazard, unstructured list, so I'm sure I'll be jumping into a lot of weird and potentially useful things. 

I started by throwing together a quick little organizer program. With that done, I'm ready to start.

Current goal: Since the first couple projects look simple, use the opportuity to learn about making GUIs. Then, make the unit converter.
